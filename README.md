## Title: Blockchain Enabled Cloud Security Leveraging Homorphic Encryption and Byzantine Fault Tolerance

#### Abstract
Cloud services can be susceptible to attacks due to their easy accessibility. Data changes in cloud computing, a newer cloud service, may compromise data security. Changed data might be utilized by evil people. People that utilize cloud computing for several reasons want their data protected. However, blockchain is an unchangeable digital record. It may be feasible to establish an unchangeable cloud computing environment utilizing cloud technology. To secure data using homomorphic encryption techniques, we aim to employ cloud computing and blockchain. The recommended method leverages Fault Tolerance to create a network of CSPs that work together depending on client demands to avoid the cloud service provider (CSP) having complete data control. After computations, all CSPs create a database master hash value. Bitcoin along with Ethereum networks use master hash values to produce unchangeable data. Keep track of the block header address to acquire the master hash numbers for evidence. The additional expenses of creating master hash values for all currencies are theoretically examined. Ethereum has faster internet speeds and cheaper client expenses compared to Bitcoin. We also outline the "ground-level implementation" and data security requirements that the proposed method meets. The method uses public cryptocurrency, letting clients set it up easily with just a wallet.

#### Introduction
In the current digital age, cloud computing emerges as a cornerstone technology reshaping how businesses and individuals harness computational resources. The inherent benefits of cloud services scalability, ondemand access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness have propelled their widespread adoption across various sectors from data intensive enterprises to agile software development environments. Despite these benefits, significant concerns about data security and privacy arise, especially given the centralized structure of many cloud systems. In these setups, data resides on servers managed by third-party providers, potentially exposing it to vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access and data breaches. Traditional security  means, though robust, fall back in managing the dynamic and sophisticated threats a cyber attacker holds. Thus there is a prime need for cloud data security in such a context which ensures information integrity coupled with confidentiality. Blockchain technology, because of its decentralized and immutable nature, provides a very good basis for strengthening cloud security. Fundamentally, blockchain works as a decentralized ledger in which transactions and data entries are cryptographically protected and can be verified across a network of nodes. Such a decentralized structure greatly diminishes the risk of individual points of failure and unauthorized data modifications commonly found in centralized cloud systems. Storage in a tamper-proof as well as transparent way leads to increased integrity of the data and the reduced risk associated with unauthorized access or manipulative data, according to reference. <br/>
Homomorphic encryption enables computations on ciphered data without having them to be first decrypted, so it adds the possibility in blockchain to further enhance security in a cloud environment without compromising the confidentiality, even when using third-party service for data processing. HE makes sure data remains encrypted throughout the process, protected from compromise via compromised cloud servers and unwanted individuals gaining access. While protecting information through transmissionand storage, it also shares information with utmost security ease while supporting tough privacy guidelines. <br/>
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is the mechanism that increases the reliability and security of cloud-based systems. In case of malicious nodes or network disruptions, such a system can function properly. BFT mechanisms ensure that the system can reach a consensus despite discrepancies or attempts to disrupt normal operations. It maintains data consistency and service availability [11]. BFT ensures protection against malicious attacks and continuous delivery of service in cloud computing, which can cause massive implications such as downtime and data inconsistencies. The amalgamation of blockchain technology and homomorphic encryption with Byzantine Fault Tolerance provides an integrated solution toward handling the diversified issues associated with cloud security. Simultaneously, this framework will constitute sensitive data protection through trust and confidence in the cloud services by bringing to offer:  <br/>
- #### Data Integrity and Transparency: The decentralized ledger of Blockchain provides tamper-proof data records that increase transparency because it reduces the risk associated with unintended auditability.  <br/>
- #### Confidentiality modification, increasing and Secure Processing: Homomorphic encryption provides secure computation on encrypted data, protecting the confidentiality of data during processing and avoiding the possibility of data exposure to unauthorized parties.  <br/>
- #### Resilience :Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanism enables cloud systems to work with integrity and provide availability of service even against attacks that are malicious or disruptive network, hence maintaining reliability and performance.  <br/>

It will help solve the current security challenges but also be ready to innovate on secure cloud computing in the future. Organizations would be able to establish an evolving security posture with the demand of digital transformation while having sensitive data safe from newly emerging threats using the best features of blockchain, homomorphic encryption, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.  <br/>
In practice, this type of security model requires deployment of blockchain-based verification mechanisms for data integrity in some homomorphic encryption schemes. To set up a distributed network architecture that meets client needs, CSPs can make use of Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus. Each cloud server will create and write hash values of their database across the public blockchain networks, which are bitcoin or ethereum networks, and are immutable with block header address. In this way, an approach not only enhances information security but also provides cost-effectiveness along with higher efficiency compared to traditional approaches. Homomorphic encryption and Byzantine Fault Tolerance are among the most important innovations in the developing secured and trusted cloud computing settings. These advance technologies will help in decreasing organizational risks by ensuring higher protection of data coupled with upholding integrity in cloud-based operations for a highly connected digital space.

#### Problem Statement

1. The architecture of cloud computing, that is in practice today has many issues related to vulnerabilities of data breaches, non-transparency and scalability issues related to concerns of the privacy of the data. This architecture heavily relies on trusted intermediaries and provides no facility of immutable data storage. 
2. The cloud computing architecture is primarily based on central servers and traditional security measures for data storage and protection. Central storage systems are very susceptible to cyberattacks and breaches. One weakness can compromise the safety and reliability of data stored through it. This may even lead to unauthorized access along with breaches. 
3. Traditional cloud systems lack transparent and immutable audit trails: that is problematic in tracing and validating the legitimacy of data transactions themselves. 
4. Since there is no mechanism for proper auditing, tracing unauthorized modifications or changes made over data becomes highly challenging.

#### Exsisting System

It contains many problems in the position of current cloud computing infrastructure. There are various types of breaches, lack of clarity, scalability, data privacies, reliance on trusted intermediaries, and numerous others. It does not provide an immutable store of data. In general, overall, cloud computing still remains relatively dependent on some particular centralized servers and uses traditional ways to secure data, but architecture may remain vulnerable to penetration by one point of weakness that causes data security violations and subsequently provides an unsecured route for unauthorized entries. In most cases, traditional cloud architectures lack clear and unmodifiable audit trails, which have hindered proper monitoring as well as authentication of a data transaction. This lack of audit capabilities leads to the incapacity to trace an unauthorized modification of data, making security risks much worse in a cloud environment.

#### Proposed System

To further improve data security through homomorphic encryption techniques within the frameworks of cloud computing and blockchain, this approach reduces risks associated with centralized control of data by cloud service providers. The strategy utilizes Byzantine Fault Tolerance to distribute CSPs based on client demands in order to decentralize data processing and storage across nodes. This decentralization reduces the vulnerability characteristic of central systems and thereby reduces the possibility of a breach and unauthorized access. After all the computations, every CSP generates a unique master hash value for the database. These values are required for data integrity as well as to produce unchangeable records. Such values are stored in blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum; they act as anchors that protect the data from tampering.  It becomes easy to validate these master hash numbers as proof of valid and original data through the tracking of block headers with addresses. The theoretical costs related to the production of master hash values by blockchain currencies indicate that Ethereum results in more favorable outcomes such as faster internet access which saves clients expenses in the payment of multiple sources as opposed to Bitcoin. <br/> From the implementation perspective, the approach outlines strict data security requirements that it meets. This configuration provides a highly secure and transparent data environment while satisfying regulatory compliance, which will encrypt and trace the data from beginning to end lifecycle. A combination of homomorphic encryption, BFT, and blockchain makes it a secure solution for cloud environments. It helps to address all the weaknesses in the current cloud infrastructure and gives them enhanced security, privacy, and reliability. This continuous improvement ensures that work is not wasted and that something new becomes a benchmark for cloud security. 

#### Conclusion

We will use a combination of homomorphic encryption with a BFT-based distributed network to provide better data security against breach or influence by cloud service providers. Homomorphic encryption does not reveal the encrypted nature of data while carrying on computations on encrypted data. Also, the BFT-supported network reduces inter-provider communication, hence improving security. In addition, cloud providers will regularly produce master hash values of their databases and record them in blockchain networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This would ensure that verification data are immutable and clients can detect any tampering through blockchain consensus mechanisms. Preliminary estimates for the cost of embedding these hash values in Ethereum indicate that it will cost about $88 per year to verify every 30 minutes. This approach integrates Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Blockchain Technology, homomorphic encryption techniques to give a firm frame for the preservation of information integrity and security at any point in cloud computing.
